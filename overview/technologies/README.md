The storage problem can be generally divided into the following sub-problems:
 - Proof of Publication, which ensures that the data show up on the network initially and the nodes can choose to download and store the data of interest or just ignore the data;
 - Proof of Storage, which ensures that the data is stored somewhere in the network and prevents losing the data;
 - Proof of Retrievability, which ensures that anyone can retrieve the data in the presence of some malicious nodes that withhold the data.
