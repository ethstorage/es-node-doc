## What is EthStorage

EthStorage is a modular and decentralized storage Layer 2 that offers programmable key-value storage powered by DA. It enables long-term DA solutions for Rollups and opens up new possibilities for fully on-chain applications like games, social networks, AI, etc.

## Motivation

The main motivation behind EthStorage is to provide a long-term DA based on Ethereum.

EIP-4844 introduces data blobs that enhance the throughput and efficiency of L2 scaling solutions like rollups. However, the blob data is only available temporarily, meaning it will be discarded in a few weeks. This has generated a significant impact: the inability of L2 to unconditionally derive the latest state from L1. If a certain piece of data can no longer be retrieved from L1, a rollup may not be possible to sync the chain.

With EthStorage as a long-term DA solution, L2s can derive from their DA layer (Ethereum DA, Celestia, EigenDA, etc. + EthStorage) any time they want.

EthStorage also opens up new possibilities for fully on-chain applications like games, social networks, AI, etc.
