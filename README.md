# Introduction

What is EthStorage

EthStorage is a storage-specific L2 network that reuses Ethereum security to extend Ethereum storage capabilities via data availability technology.

Motivation

The major goal of EthStorage is to extend Ethereum storage capabilities by reusing Ethereum security properties.&#x20;

EIP-4844/Danksharding data is temporarily available, i.e., the data will be discarded in a few weeks. EthStorage will allow users to optionally extend the availability time of DA BLOBs in a fully decentralized way.&#x20;

Other applications include long-term decentralized storage solutions for other Rollups such as Optimistic Rollups and ZK Rollups, fully decentralized frontend with dynamic websites,&#x20;
